# Computer Networking

> A set of 4 small projects built in an attempt to understand Computer Networking Concepts

### 1. Mailing Client

### 2. DDOS script

- A DDOS is when an attacker attempts to send multiple requests to a single server in an attempt to exhaust the server's handling capacity, so that the server cannot handle more requests from legitimate clients.

- In this script, the router to which the computer is connected to is DDOSed.

- Threading in python is not true threading, it is simulated multithreading. So DDOS-ing in python is not a great idea.

- Moreover, the number of requests / second in this script is very low, which makes it a not-so-good-script.

- DDOS-ing is illegal. Do it on your own servers / local computers. :)
